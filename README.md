# News Site

This is a news site about yoga! 
The task was to create a responsive web page with a header containing a logo, the name of the site and a navbar. The main content was a big news section and a grid of newscard. The article content was created with ChatGPT.

## The problem

This was the first ever HTML+CSS-project for me, so there was a lot of theory to be studied.
When I started with the news site I listed the requirements and made a quick sketch (pen and paper) of how I wanted to page to look.
When it was time to code I realized how difficult it was to create a good structure. So after some trial-and-error I decided to start with the header. I found a great tutorial online on W3schools. Then I did some more googling when the title didn't center as planned.
Then I moved on to the big featured section and found answers in some forum on how to center content.
The grid for the "other news" was done with some help from the pre-course.

If I had more time (or perhaps more experience) I would plan more ahead of starting. Like what colors do I want where? And I would start working out the layout before I had too much content in the HTML-document, it's hard to test and change in the files when the content starts to add up!
